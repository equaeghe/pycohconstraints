python code for generating coherence constraints for lower previsions

This repository contains two directories, both with Python code to generate constraints sets.
In *2010* you can find python code, bash scripts, and results from research done in 2009-2010.
In *2013* you can find a python module and some python testing scripts from research done in 2012-2013.
The approaches taken differ; the later work is as far as we know more straightforward and more efficient, but the approaches differ so much that the early work should not be discounted out of hand: it may still have its advantages.
